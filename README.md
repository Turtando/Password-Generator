# Password Generator
https://turtando.github.io/Password-Generator/

# Description 
My purpose in creating this Password Generator was to write a script that enabled any user who accessed the site to be prompted to create their own secure password. The password would have to pass certain criteria if the user wished to be successful in generating one. The parameters of the password were constructed from taking either a letter (uppercase or lowercase), a special symbol such as a "$" or a number and between the length of 8 to 128 characters.
